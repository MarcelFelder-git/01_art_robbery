## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- **API Handling:** Learned how to fetch artwork data from an API and dynamically display it in the interface.  
- **Interactive UI:** Implemented a "flashlight" effect that acts as a mask, allowing users to inspect paintings in detail.  
- **Dynamic Difficulty & Rewards:** Created filters that adjust the intensity of the images based on difficulty, and a reward system where users earn in-game money by identifying the correct artwork quickly.  
- **State Management:** Managing the flashlight position, filters, and user rewards taught me efficient state handling in React.  
- **UI/UX Design:** Learned to design a visually engaging and interactive experience that encourages exploration and strategy.
